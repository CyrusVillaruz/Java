/**
 * Question 2-5
 * - Inserting a space before the comment helps make the code easier to read.

 * Question 2-6
 * - The program prompts me with a Syntax error
 * 
 * Question 2-7
 * - The second "//" after the initial "//" does not cause problems.
 * 
 * Question 2-8
 * - I do not think I have violated any of the documentation guidelines in Appendix F.
 * - Two things the guidelines discourage that I would likely do in commenting would be to make
 * comments after the program is finished and not updating comments as I develop the program.

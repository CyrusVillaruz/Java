// 1: Java is case sensitive, so "simple" and "Simple" are treated as different identifiers.
// Java also encourages the identifier to start with an upper-case letter
    
// 2: This is a good choice to name the program
    
// 3: Identifiers cannot start with a digit

// 4: The "_" seem to be unnecessary, but the identifier can work
    
// 5: Identifiers cannot have an asterisk (*)
    
// 6: Starting with a "$" is discouraged, and I would not know the purpose of an identifier with just numbers
    
// 7: Identifiers cannot have an exclamation mark (!)
